<h1> Problems Faced </h1>
  <ul> 1. Learning real usage of flexbox </ul>
  <ul> 2. Media query. </ul>
  <ul> 3. Overlay only img and not whole div box. </ul>
  
  <p> Overall the project took 2 days (mostly reading doucmentation haha.) 
  I gained more confidence in the langs of HMTL and CSS from this and found knwoing what names of rules to look up made the whole ordeal not as diffuclt as I thought and I gained a huge influx of new skills from this project. </p>
